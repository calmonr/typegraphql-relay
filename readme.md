# TypeGraphQL Relay

> Relay-compliant GraphQL server using TypeGraphQL and TypeORM boilerplate.

---

## Introduction

This is a GraphQL server boilerplate that follows the [Global Object Identification](https://graphql.org/learn/global-object-identification/), [GraphQL Server Specification](https://relay.dev/docs/en/graphql-server-specification.html) and [GraphQL Cursor Connections Specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) specifications.

## WIP

This documentation is being completely rewritten explaining better how to get started. This means that this repository is constantly changing and that is why we don't recommend using it in production until all features have been completed.
